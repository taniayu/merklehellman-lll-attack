# Attacking Merkle-Hellman Using LLL
This is a Python 2.7 implementation of a basis reduction attack on the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem using the LLL algorithm.

```liblll.py``` is taken from an existing implementation at https://github.com/kutio/liblll.

```tester.py``` includes test code used to evaluate the system implemented, which can be used as a sample for using this implmeentation.
